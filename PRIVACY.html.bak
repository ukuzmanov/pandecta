            <h2>PRIVACY STATEMENT </h2>
            <p>Pandecta Inc. considers itself a steward of your personal
              information. We are committed to clear, fair, and transparent data
              practices. Below please find the description of our privacy
              policy. </p>
            <h3> Personal Information </h3>
            <p>Personal information is information about you as an individual
              and allows us to identify and contact you. This information may
              include your name, contact information (email address, phone
              number), demographic information (age, gender, etc.),
              health-related information relevant to the analysis, and others.
              You do have a choice as to which information to provide, however,
              not providing some of the information can limit the extent of the
              services that we can provide.</p>
            <p> We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your
              personal information with any third party, unless (1) you have
              authorized us to do so, (2) we are legally required to do so, for
              example, in response to a subpoena, a court order, or other legal
              process, and/or (3) it is necessary to do so, in order to protect
              and defend the rights of Pandecta Inc. </p>
            <h3>Why Do We Need Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We need your personal information to provide you with your unique
              proteomic analysis. The more information we know about you (age,
              gender, medical history), the better the analytics (risk
              assessment), in terms of health and wellness, we can provide.
              After the test is completed, you can choose if we should store
              your personal information or discard it. Discarding your personal
              information will limit the extent of future services that we can
              provide. </p>
            <h3> Sample Collection </h3>
            <p> We collect biological samples (i.e. blood) for proteomic
              analysis. This sample is tied to your personal information and
              used to generate proteomic data. After processing, analysis, and
              report generation, the remaining sample will be destroyed. We will
              not share or sell your blood or proteomic samples. </p>
            <h3> Data Collection </h3>
            <p> “Data” refers to the proteomic data. This data will be generated
              from your blood sample and attached to your personal information
              for identification purposes. This data will be used to create your
              personalized analytics which provides insights into your health
              and disease state. The more information we have about you, the
              better analytics we can provide. Once you receive the report, you
              can choose if you wish Pandecta Inc. to retain your identifiable
              information (name, address) or not. We must retain identifiable
              data if you plan to track your changes in your proteome over time.
              We do not sell your identifiable data (including data that can be
              used to identify physical or mental conditions or treatments). We
              do not share your identifiable data (including data that can be
              used to identify physical or mental conditions or treatments) with
              third parties without your explicit consent (received in writing
              and separate from this agreement). </p>
            <p> Aggregate Data: Your data will be combined with the data from
              other individuals which we use for statistical analysis and risk
              assessment. We use aggregate data for multiple purposes including
              but not limited to, improvement of our product and research
              purposes. Aggregate data is general information and does not
              contain information that can be used to identify you as an
              individual. You will be asked to agree to the use of your
              deidentified data in the aggregate form for product improvement,
              research, and other purposes. </p>
            <h3> Take Charge of Your Data </h3>
            <p> It is important to us that you understand how your personal
              information is collected and used by us. Our Privacy Policy is
              here to clarify our data practices. Our Privacy Policy is updated
              from time to time, but when this happens we will let you know via
              email before the change becomes effective and you will have an
              opportunity to change your preferences. </p>
            <h3> Communications </h3>
            <p> We may use your contact information to communicate with you
              about our services, provide updates, and promotional offers. </p>
            <h3> Data Sharing </h3>
            <p> With your consent, we may share your anonymized data with
              third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf,
              such as laboratory analysis and data processing. These providers
              do not know your identity, and proteome itself cannot be used for
              identification purposes. In addition, these providers are bound by
              confidentiality agreements and are prohibited from using your data
              for any other purpose. Similarly, anonymized and/or aggregate data
              may be shared with research collaborators for scientific studies.
              These collaborations help advance scientific knowledge and improve
              public health. </p>
            <h3> Legal Requirements </h3>
            <p> We will disclose your data if required by law or in response to
              valid requests by public authorities (e.g., court orders,
              subpoenas). </p>
            <h3> Protection Measures </h3>
            <p> We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the
              protection of your personal information. This includes encryption,
              access controls, and secure storage facilities. </p>
            <h3> Contact Us </h3>

              or our data practices, please <a href="mailto:info@pandecta.ca">contact
