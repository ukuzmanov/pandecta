              <p> <b><i>A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO</i></b></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5> In recent years, many of my friends in their early 50s and
                60s, and even their children in their 20s, have been diagnosed
                with cancer. In early 2023, my lifelong friend, whom I will call
                Mike, was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic colon cancer at the
                age of 52. The 5-year survival rate for colon cancer is 91% when
                detected at stage 1, and 72% when detected at stages II and III.
                However, for stage IV metastatic colon cancer, it drops
                drastically to 14% (7, 8, 9). <br>
                <br>
                In Canada, screening guidelines recommend colonoscopies starting
                at age 50, while in the US they start at age 45 (recently
                lowered from 50). Mike should have had a colonoscopy at age 50,
                but due to limited access to regular screening during COVID-19,
                and thinking he was in good health, he didn't. By the time
                symptoms appeared and he consulted a physician, it was almost
                too late. He had a huge tumor at the entrance to the rectum,
                more than 20 spots on his liver, and tumors in his lungs. He was
                seen at one of the best hospitals in Canada and provided with
                chemotherapy. However, given the metastatic condition of his
                cancer, he was shuttled from doctor to doctor as it was unclear
                which cancer to treat first. Rectum or liver? Chemotherapy or
                surgery? In early 2024, he was given two years to live and told
                nothing more could be done for him. <br>
                <br>
                Fortunately, he was referred to another excellent hospital in
                Canada where doctors were more willing to make decisions. Mike
                underwent aggressive chemotherapy to decrease his tumor mass,
                surgery to remove the rectum tumor and part of his liver, and
                was provided a liver pump to deliver treatment straight to his
                remaining liver and continues on a chemotherapy regimen for his
                colorectal cancer. <br>
                <br>
                Can you imagine the physical and mental toll on Mike’s body and
                mind? <br>
                <br>
                If anybody can beat the 14% odds, it is Mike. Mike was always in
                excellent physical shape and while he was never on any specific
                diets, he always ate healthy. Even now, with his body ravaged by
                a disease and weaken by surgery and continued chemotherapy, he
                continues to exercise every day while at the same time,
                addressing his metabolic health. He is committed to beating the
                odds, and I am confident that he can. <br>
                <br>
                Could Pandecta have provide Mike with earlier signs of
                colorectal cancer? The outcome would have been totally
                different!<br>
                <br>
                At Pandecta, we are determined to help people take control of
                their health!</h5>
